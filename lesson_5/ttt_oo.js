Game design:
[] The program should display the welcome message before the first game starts. It should never display the message again.
[] The program should display the results after each game ends, but before asking whether the human player wants to play again.
[] After the game ends, the program should ask the human player whether they want to play again. If they do, then the program should start a new game of TTT. Otherwise, it should end the program.
[] Keep score by tracking how many times the player and computer each win. Don't use global or static variables. The first player to reach 3 wins is the winner of the match. Be sure to report the current score after each game, and make it clear when a player wins the match. For simplicity, end the program after playing one full match. You don't need a "play again" question for the match, just for individual games.
[] Change the game so that the human and computer take turns going first during a match. When the human goes first in one game, the computer should go first in the next, and vice versa. Don't worry about swapping the player's markers for each game: the human can always use `X` while the computer uses `O`.
[] The program should display the goodbye message when the human player decides that he doesn't want to play again. It should never display the goodbye message before that.

[] Computer choices:
  If any square is a potential winner, pick that square
  Else if any square is at risk, pick that square
  Else if the center square (5) is empty, pick it
  Else pick a random square

Minor revisions:
[] The program should accept `y` `yes` or `n`, `no` (in lowercase or uppercase) as valid answers at the "play again"; all other answers are invalid.
