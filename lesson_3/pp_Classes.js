In JavaScript, classes are first-class values. This means that classes can be used anywhere a value is used.
They can be passed around to functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables.

// The `static` modifier makes it so that the method `manufacturer()` can only be called on the class `Telivision`. It cannot be called on instances of `Telivision`. `model` on the other hand can only be called by instances of the `Telivision` object.
